Our application was developed using bitnami wordpress hosted on AWS server.

Our application has been significantly developed for working professionals in Melbourne to find a suitable workplace. 
Our application helps professionals working from home due to covid 19 restrictions to find appropriate co-working space based on their preferences. 
Co-working spaces offer plenty of benefits at affordable prices with lots of flexibility.
Unlike other products in the market, our application allows users to select a co-working space and show nearby cafes and restaurants, public transport and parking facilities.
We also provide information about upcoming events and recreational activities in the city.
